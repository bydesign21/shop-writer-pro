        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
          ShopWriterPro started in a Body Shop, looking for the answer to not
          having an in-house writer. There needs to be a better solution to this
          problem for shop owners, they don’t deserve to lose out on a
          significant amount of money just because of missing one employee. Even
          more importantly, Insurance companies can be difficult to negotiate
          and appraise damages, so we felt there should be something to help the
          body shop show the proper way to repair the vehicle. All of our
          estimators have experience working in Body Shops throughout the United
          States, and all have the same goal in mind.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Values</h2>
        <p>
          We value the importance of writing accurate estimates, with OEM
          procedures to show the safe and proper techniques to repair the
          vehicle. Giving an accurate estimate to the Insurance/customer shows
          an accurate game plan to repair the vehicle back to its OEM
          specifications. Safety, Accuracy, and the Body Shop owner’s peace of
          mind are what we value and strive to achieve. ￼
        </p>

        <h2>Our Technology</h2>
        <p>
          ShopWriterPro and our Estimators use CCC estimating technology, and
          industry leading software to write the estimate and/or supplement
          needed. Each Estimator also has access to OEM procedures for each make
          and model they are estimating. AI technology is used to detect the
          damage through photos, giving our estimators a second set of eyes when
          searching for all of the accident-related damages.
