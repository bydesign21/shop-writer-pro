              <h1>No More Hassle</h1>
              <h4>
                Oftentimes, writing up estimate sheets for incoming damaged cars can
                become very tedious.
              </h4>
              <p>
                If done incorrectly, insurance companies will reward you less money,
                especially with only an insurance adjuster appraising the car, who's
                job is to assess the car in an attempt to reward as little money as
                possible (often at the risk of labor profits).
              </p>
              <p>
                If youâ€™re constantly struggling with organizing public adjuster
                visits, paying over priced freelance writers, or worried about your
                employees spending time on write ups rather than working on cars then
                Shop Writer Pro is for you!
