        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
          Shop Writer Pro was developed by experienced body shop owners who
          encountered the challenge of lacking in- house estimators but were
          determined to virtualize the process while keeping the accuracy and
          quality of estimates at a high standard. Our goal is to keep the
          process cost effective and time efficient while still providing an
          estimate/supplement that is beneficial for the body shop.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Values</h2>
        <p>
          We value the importance of writing accurate estimates, with OEM
          procedures to show the safe and proper techniques to repair the
          vehicle. Giving an accurate estimate to the Insurance/customer shows
          an accurate game plan to repair the vehicle back to its OEM
          specifications. Safety, Accuracy, and the Body Shop owner's peace of
          mind are what we value and strive to achieve.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Technology</h2>
        <p>
          ShopWriterPro and our Estimators use CCC estimating technology, and
          industry leading software to write the estimate and/or supplement
          needed. Each Estimator also has access to OEM procedures for each make
          and model they are estimating. AI technology is used to detect the
          damage through photos, giving our estimators a second set of eyes when
          searching for all of the accident-related damages.
